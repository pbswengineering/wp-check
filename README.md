## Why WP Check

Because I needed a quick way to verify the status of multiple WordPress isntallations on multiple servers.

## Usage

Firstly, copy wp-check.py on your server.

Secondly, ensure that all requirements are installed (e.g. `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

Finally, run the script like this: `python3 wp-check.py /directory/with/wordpress/installations`.
